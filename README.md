# **Secret Santa Generator**
---
## **Description**
The Secret Santa Generator is a command line program made in Python. The program randomly assigns secret santas using a user-inputted list of people. Then, an email is sent out telling each person who they are giving a gift to for Secret Santa.

## **Requirements**
```
pip install smtplib
```
```
pip install random
```
```
pip install re
```

---
## **Steps to Execute Code**
- Every user-inputted email must be valid and exist, or else the code will not function properly. 
- The user will need to input an email as the "from" email. In order for the smtplib library to send the message over the server, you must turn on the "Allow less secure apps".
